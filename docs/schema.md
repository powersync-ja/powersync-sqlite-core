## `ps_buckets`

`ps_buckets` stores information about [buckets](https://docs.powersync.com/architecture/powersync-protocol#buckets) relevant to clients.
A bucket is instantiated for every row returned by a parameter query in a [bucket definition](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/sync-rules/organize-data-into-buckets#organize-data-into-buckets).

Clients create entries in `ps_buckets` when receiving a checkpoint message from the sync service, they are also
responsible for removing buckets that are no longer relevant to the client.
There is also a special `$local` bucket representing pending
uploads.

We store the following information in `ps_buckets`:

1. `id`: Internal (client-side only), alias to rowid for foreign references.
2. `name`: The name of the bucket as received from the sync service.
3. `last_applied_op`: The last operation id that has been verified and published to views (meaning that it was part of
a checkpoint and that we have validated its checksum).
4. `target_op`: Only used for `$local`. TODO: Document further.
5. `add_checksum`: TODO: Document further.
6. `op_checksum`: TODO: Document further.
7. `pending_delete`: TODO: Appears to be unused, document further.
8. `count_at_last`: The amount of operations in the bucket at the last verified checkpoint.
9. `count_since_last`: The amount of operations downloaded since the last verified checkpoint.
